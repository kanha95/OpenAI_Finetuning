## OpenAI Model Fine-Tuning

This repository contains code and resources for fine-tuning an OpenAI language model. The objective is to customize the model for specific tasks or datasets, such as analyzing medical reports or creating specialized NLP applications. Below, you will find details about the files and their purposes, as well as instructions for running the code.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Custom_Tuning.ipynb**
- This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for fine-tuning the OpenAI model.
- Includes preprocessing steps, fine-tuning execution, and evaluation of the model.
- Use this notebook to experiment with different datasets and fine-tuning parameters.

### 2. **fine_tuning_data.jsonl**
- JSONL (JSON Lines) file containing the training dataset for fine-tuning.
- Format: Each line is a JSON object with `prompt` and `completion` keys.
- Customize this file with your specific training data.

### 3. **fine_tuning_data_val.jsonl**
- JSONL file containing validation data to evaluate the model's performance during fine-tuning.
- Similar format to `fine_tuning_data.jsonl`.

### 4. **medical_reports.csv**
- A CSV file containing raw medical reports data.
- Use this data as input for preprocessing and creating fine-tuning datasets.

### 5. **reports.csv** and **reports_copy.csv**
- Additional CSV files containing variations of the medical reports dataset.
- Use these files for experimentation or additional training/validation data.

### 6. **README.md**
- This file serves as the documentation for the repository.

### 7. **PTCenteredPurple.png**
- A placeholder or branding image related to the project.

## How to Use

### 1. **Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 2. **Prepare the Data**
- Edit or replace `fine_tuning_data.jsonl` and `fine_tuning_data_val.jsonl` with your specific training and validation datasets.
- Use the `medical_reports.csv` or `reports.csv` files for creating these JSONL files if needed.

### 3. **Fine-Tuning the Model**
1. Open `Custom_Tuning.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, fine-tune the model, and evaluate its performance.

### 4. **Evaluate the Model**
- Use the validation dataset (`fine_tuning_data_val.jsonl`) to assess the model's accuracy and relevance for your task.

## Results
- Fine-tuned models can be used for tasks like medical text generation, question answering, or other domain-specific NLP tasks.
- Save and deploy the fine-tuned model for production use.

---

## Notes
- Fine-tuning large models requires adequate computational resources, such as GPUs or TPUs.
- Be mindful of OpenAI's usage policies when fine-tuning and deploying their models.
